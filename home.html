        Responsive Redesign

        For this project, I redesigned the homepage of Mostra Coffee’s website. Mostra Coffee
        is a local coffee shop in San Diego, and as a coffee lover, I go there
        at least once a week. I redesigned the homepage to improve usability and
        learnability. I identified problems in the original website, created 
        low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes to fit different screen sizes, 
        and used the prototypes as a guideline to build a new responsive website.

      <div id="p">
       <li>
        <b>No hierarchy of elements.</b> There is a hamburger menu in the top left corner
        of the website with the following options: Order To Go, Shop, About, Locations & 
        Menu, and Contact. However, the same options are also scattered throughout the website. 
        The website not only repeats the same information but also shows no hierarchy in the information. 
      </li>
      </div>
      <div id="p">
        <li>
          <b>Too many clicks required to complete a single task.</b> For instance, to find a nearby location,
          a user has to click on the Locations & Menu button. Instead of forcing users to click a button 
          to find this information, it might be useful to just display it in the homepage. 
        </li>
      </div>
      <div id="p">
        <li>
          <b>Minimal white space.</b> There is not much white space throughout the homepage,
          and it is clumped with a lot of text and images.
        </li>
      </div>
      <div id="p">
        <li>
          <b>Unnecessary buttons.</b> When a user clicks on the Locations & Menu option, 
          the website navigates to another page with the different locations. Under each location,
          there is a View Menu button. However, when one clicks on the View Menu button, the menu
          that is displayed is the same for all the locations. Thus, it might be helpful if the 
          website has just one central Menu button in a navigation menu so that new users know 
          that the menu is the same for all the locations.

          After using WebAIM WAVE on the original website, 
          I found that the website does not have a heading structure. 
          I also noticed that one of the titles in the homepage has very low contrast, 
          making it difficult for the users to read the title since it is displayed over an image. 
          There were two missing form labels for input boxes where users are able to input their 
          first name and last name to join the Mostra Coffee community. When I tested the website 
          by using a screen-reader, I noticed that because of these missing form labels, the screen-reader 
          was unable to detect these input boxes. In addition to missing form labels, there were two empty 
          form labels, one for a hamburger menu and one for an image. When using voice over to test the website, 
          I found that when I clicked on the hamburger menu, it said that I was on an image. 
          Then, when I pressed on the image, the voice over said I was on heading level 1. It seemed like the 
          voice over could not actually detect whether I was on the hamburger menu or the image.

          I kept the hamburger menu to allow users to navigate 
          through the website. However, I placed the hamburger menu on the top right corner of the website 
          instead of the top left corner. Additionally, I placed the main image underneath the hamburger 
          menu so that users are able to clearly see the hamburger menu. In the original website, 
          the hamburger menu is overlapping with the main image, which may make it difficult for users to notice it. 
        </div>
        <div id="p">
          Because the mobile screen is small, I deleted the welcoming message, "Welcome to MOSTRA," as well
          as the description of the coffee shop in the redesign. My priority was keeping essential information, and I thought that 
          the welcoming message and the description can also be found in the About page of the website. 
        </div>
        <div id="p2">
          <b>Tablet:</b>

        <img id="lo-fi-tablet" src="lo-fi tablet.jpeg">
        <div id="p">
          Similar to the mobile wireframe, I also kept the hamburger menu and deleted the welcoming message and the description 
          of Mostra Coffee in the tablet wireframe. 
        </div>
        <div id="p">
          Moreover, in the original website, the Instagram Page section of the homepage has 4 columns that display the Instagram photos (for tablet and desktop screen sizes). 
          To keep consistency with the rest of the website, I changed the 4 columns to 3 columns in the tablet wireframe.
        </div>
        <div id="p2">
          <b>Desktop:</b> 
        </div>
        <img id="lo-fi-desktop" src="lo-fi desktop.jpeg">
        <div id="p">
          Similar to the tablet wireframe, I also changed the Instagram Page section of the homepage in the dekstop wireframe so that 
          it now displays 3 columns rather 4 columns. 
        </div>
        <div id="p">
          Instead of a hamburger menu, I added a central navigation bar at the top right corner. This improves accessibility because it allows users to easily see the different options 
          in the website.
        </div>
        <div id="p">
          Since the desktop screen is so much bigger than the mobile and tablet screens, I kept the welcoming message, "Welcome to MOSTRA," 
          as well as the description of the coffee shop. 
        </div>
       
        <div id="p2">
          <b>For all wireframes: </b>
        </div>
        <div id="p">
          I included a “Find the nearest store”
          section in the homepage so that both new and returning users are able to search the 
          nearest Mostra Coffee based on their current location. This improves both accessibility 
          and usability because users no longer need to click on the Locations & Menu button to 
          find the nearest location. Instead, this information is directly on the homepage. 
          Furthermore, the original website only includes a Google Maps image of the nearest location. 
          The redesign allows users to enter their zipcode in order to actually search for the closest store. 
        </div>
        <div id="p">
          I also included a “Best Sellers: Coffee Drinks & Tea section” in the homepage. 
          The original website only has a “Best Sellers” section for their coffee beans, which 
          assumes that users of this website are mostly interested in buying coffee beans rather than drinks. 
          For new and returning users who want to order drinks online for pickup, it would be useful to have 
          a section that displays best-selling drinks as well.

          To test the accessibility of my website, I played with the size of the browser to see how the 
          website looks in different screen sizes. I was able to see that the website is responsive! For instance,
          the navigation bar changed into a hamburger menu when I made the size of the browser as small as a tablet screen or a mobile phone screen.
          I also tried changing the font size on my browser. When I made the font size really large on Google Chrome, I noticed that it made the hamburger
          menu become not aligned to the logo for the mobile phone screen. Thus, I fixed this problem by making the font size smaller for the logo for the mobile phone screen.
          Finally, I tested the website's responsiveness by using the Google Chrome Responsive Tool and WebAIM Wave.

        This project made me think a lot about how a layout in a website may look different based on the screen size. 
        I empathized with users and thought about their needs and motivations for looking at a particular website, and 
        I didn't realize how much work it took to design different layouts for one page of a website. Through this project, 
        I was also able to improve my skills in HTML/CSS and gain more experience in creating wireframes and prototypes.
